# Bon-Voyage
“Bon Voyage team is trying to provide a high level models of the reservation/booking system to build a system which is reusable in different platforms, maintainable with low cost and self-explained in its software product line while adopting the best practices of Model- Driven software Development.”

“Bon Voyage” is an online reservation system (a website). The specificity of “Bon voyage” is giving access to a wide choice of flight companies, hotels and car renting agencies. Also, the reservation system we propose will be able to go through all the offers and only show the most interesting offers (in terms of discount/price). The main services that our system will provide for now are:

•	Transport reservation/renting (e.g. flight reservation, car rental, etc.)

•	Accommodation reservation (hotel room, etc.)

•	Activities tickets (e.g. Concerts, museums)

The list of the offered service might be extended as we go further in the project.

“Bon Voyage” provides a catalog in which there is many type of services as aforementioned are:

•	Transport reservation

•	Accommodation reservation

•	Activity reservation

The online customer can select one of these services. Then, he/she can search for available offers by specifying the details that suit him/her the best. For example, when selecting “Transport reservation”, the customer can add the desired mean of transport, the desired date, the departure and the destination. Each service has its specific search filters. After the detailed search confirmation, the system shows a list of the most pertinent offers in order of the cheapest price.

Once a customer is interested in an offer he/she can select it and view its details if needed. After that, he/she has to sign in (if an account has been made, otherwise he/she has to sign up) to book the selected service and to make the payment. If the payment is processed successfully, the customer receives his printable ticket or reservation confirmation. The customer is able to cancel the reservation before making the payment. Each cancelation after successful payment has to be made in accordance to its company policy.

# System description

“Bon Voyage” is an online reservation system (a website). The specificity of “Bon voyage” is giving access to a wide choice of flight companies, hotels and car renting agencies. Also, the reservation system we propose will be able to go through all the offers and only show the most interesting offers (in terms of discount/price). 
The main services that our system will provide for now are: 

•	Transport reservation/renting (e.g. flight reservation, car rental, etc.)

•	Accommodation reservation (hotel room, etc.)

•	Activities tickets (e.g. Concerts, museums)

The list of the offered service might be extended as we go further in the project.

“Bon Voyage” provides a catalog in which there is many type of services as aforementioned are:

•	Transport reservation

•	Accommodation reservation

•	Activity reservation

The online customer can select one of this services. Then he can search for available offers by specifying the details that suits him the best. For example, when selecting “Transport reservation”, the customer can add the desired mean of transport, the   date, the departure and the destination. Each service has it specific search filters. After the search details confirmation, the systems shows a list of the most pertinent offers in terms of discount. 

Once a customer is interested by an offer he can select it and view its details if he wants. After that, he has to sign in (if he have an account otherwise he has to sign up) to book the selected service and to make the payment. If the payment is processed successfully, the customer receives his printable ticket or reservation confirmation via email (to be discussed!). The customer is able to cancel the reservation before making the payment. Every canceling after the payment is related to the company policy.
